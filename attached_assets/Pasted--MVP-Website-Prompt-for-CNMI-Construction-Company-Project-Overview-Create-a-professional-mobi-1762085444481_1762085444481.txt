"Our Story"

Pacific Stone Builders was founded in 1998 by Juan Tenorio, a third-generation Saipan resident who saw the need for a locally-owned construction company that truly understood the unique challenges of building in the Northern Marianas.

From our humble beginnings with a crew of five, we've grown into one of CNMI's premier general contractors, completing over 200 projects across Saipan, Tinian, and Rota. But we've never forgotten our roots.

Today, our 40+ person team is 100% local, with deep ties to the communities we serve. We're not just building structures - we're building the future of our islands, one project at a time.
